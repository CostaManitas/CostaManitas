<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a landing page for a handyman service named Costa Manitas.
PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- The design should follow a comic style, based on a flyer provided by the user.
- The entire page must be in Spanish.
- It must list all the services mentioned in the flyer.
- A prominent WhatsApp contact method, including a QR code, is required.
- The initial color palette is black and white with yellow accents.
- The structure should include: Hero, About, Services, Gallery, and Contact sections.
- The project must be SEO-friendly with pre-rendered HTML, suitable for a static hosting provider (DonDominio).
- The final code should be delivered via a GitHub repository.

**User's preferred language**:
The user communicates in both Spanish and Italian. The agent has been primarily responding in Spanish. The next agent MUST respond in Spanish but be aware that the user might switch to Italian.

**what currently exists?**
The project was initially built using Create React App (CRA). After several design iterations and fixes, the user raised concerns about the SEO performance of a Client-Side Rendered (CSR) application. Following this, the user approved a migration to Next.js to enable Static Site Generation (SSG) for optimal SEO. The agent has started this migration, setting up the Next.js project structure, and has achieved an initial successful static build ( and ). The output is in the  directory.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was working on migrating the application from Create React App to Next.js. After running into multiple build errors related to dependencies and Server-Side Generation (SSG) compatibility, the agent managed to create a simplified version of the main page that successfully builds and exports as a static site. The agent's last action was to view the generated  to confirm that the content was pre-rendered.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent and screenshot tool. The agent needs to visually verify the migrated Next.js site, compare it against the last approved CRA version, and ensure all functionality is working as expected.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** The user is not satisfied with the style of the service icons, stating they do not match the comic style of the flyer (last mentioned in message #103).
-   **Issue 2:** The Next.js migration may have caused visual or functional regressions. The agent simplified components to get the build to pass, but it's not confirmed if the site is a 1:1 match with the previous version (e.g., the image gallery/carousel might be missing).

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Service icons lack the desired comic style.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent first tried using  icons and then attempted to create more illustrative icons using CSS and background images. Neither fully satisfied the user.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Call  with a highly specific prompt to generate images that match the user's comic style reference. Example prompt: .
        2.  Integrate the new images into the services section in .
        3.  Take a screenshot and ask the user for confirmation.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To align the visual design with the user's core requirement of a comic style landing page and achieve user satisfaction.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** Blocked on Complete and Verify Next.js Migration. This should be addressed after the technical migration is stable.

-   **Issue 2: Potential regressions from Next.js migration.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent encountered build errors and resolved them by simplifying component implementations. This may have removed functionality.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Take a screenshot of the current state of the Next.js application.
        2.  Carefully compare it with screenshots of the last approved Create React App version.
        3.  Identify any visual discrepancies or missing components (especially the image gallery).
        4.  Re-implement any missing features in an SSG-compatible way. For interactive components like a carousel, use the  directive and ensure they hydrate correctly on the client-side without breaking the static build.
        5.  Run yarn run v1.22.22

    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To ensure the migrated site is feature-complete and matches the design the user previously approved.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete and Verify Next.js Migration (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent has a successful static build in . The immediate next step is to test and verify this build (see Issue 2 checklist). Then, implement the full SEO details provided by the user in message #155 into  and .
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A fully functional, visually correct, and SEO-optimized static site built with Next.js that is ready for final user review and deployment.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **(P0)** Fix service icons to match the comic style (Issue 1).
    - **(P1)** Update the user's GitHub repository () with the final, working Next.js project code.
    - **(P2)** Provide updated and final deployment instructions for DonDominio, specifying that the build artifacts are in the  directory and confirming the  file is correct and present.

**Completed work in this session**
-   Initial landing page built with Create React App.
-   Multiple design iterations completed based on user feedback (color scheme, logo, layout, component removal).
-   Established a GitHub repository for the project.
-   **Recently completed:**
    -   Initiated and achieved a basic successful build for the migration from Create React App to Next.js to enable Static Site Generation (SSG) for SEO.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
-   **Architecture:** Static Site Generation (SSG) using Next.js .
-   **Backend:** None. This is a purely static website.
-   **SEO:** The primary driver for the migration. Involves pre-rendered HTML, meta tags, and structured data (JSON-LD).
-   **Deployment:** Static file hosting on a shared provider (DonDominio) using FTP or a similar method.

**key DB schema**
- N/A

**changes in tech stack**
-   **Create React App → Next.js:** Major change to move from a Client-Side Rendering (CSR) framework to one that supports Static Site Generation (SSG) for SEO purposes.

**All files of reference**
-   : The main landing page component where most UI and content resides.
-   : The root layout, important for defining global metadata (title, description).
-   : Defines the static export configuration ().
-   : The directory containing the final build artifacts to be deployed.
-   : Apache configuration file required by the hosting provider for SPA routing and optimization. This file must be included in the final deployment package.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user's primary goal for the Next.js migration is **SEO**. Ensure all SEO details (meta tags, structured data) from message #155 are correctly implemented and present in the final HTML.
-   The final output must be a **fully static site**. Do not introduce any server-side dependencies. The  in  must be maintained.
-   The final code must be pushed to the user's GitHub repository: . The user has provided credentials in the past, but it's better to ask again if needed.
-   The user is technically aware and will inspect the final HTML for pre-rendered content.
